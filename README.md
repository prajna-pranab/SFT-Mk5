# SFT-Mk5 - FreeCAD Project

This is a [FreeCAD](https://freecad.org/) project to model the [Switched Flux Transmission](https://tomboy-pink.co.uk/SFT/) device invented by Prajna Pranab. This is the Mk5 version, for the Mk 4 please refer to [my SFT repo](https://github.com/prajna-pranab/SFT)

The Mk 4 version was successfully printed and assembled but the transmission system was a bit too flimsy and there was no adjustment designed in, so this is a complete redesign for easier printing, a simpler and more robust transmission system and it should be easier to assemble, adjust and test.

If you're downloading the FreeCAD model rather than just the STLs or Prusa files then you will want to open asm-SFT-Mk5.FCStd to work with the full assembly. That is an Assembly 4 file and will open the files for all the other parts. You will also need to install the Assembly 4 Workbench and the Fasteners Workbench from the FreeCAD Addon manager.
